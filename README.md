## The problem:
  
Is hard to choose a place to live. You need to have a lot of variables on mind.
- The public transport?
- A parking lot for my car?
- Is too far for my couple place?
- How much time I have to travel to get to my workplace?
- Is the best place too expensive?

## How the app can help?

Fireplace help you thinking in all that things.

You need to tell your needs and the app is going to create a heatmap showing you the places that can fit your needs.

## I like the idea. Can I help?

Yes.

- Helping with the design
- Saying thanks with a Star :grimacing:
